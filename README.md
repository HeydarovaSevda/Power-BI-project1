I successfully completed my Power BI project. Initially, I imported data from an Excel (.xlsx) file, and after cleaning the data, I proceeded to construct my dashboard. Within the dashboard, an analysis is available to explore the correlation between individuals' current roles, their average salaries, their respective sectors, opinions on working with data, decisions to change employment based on salary satisfaction scores, and the gender distribution within this dataset.Additionally, it's important to note that the dashboard design is my own creation.
